          <h1>Ultra runners</h1>

          <h2></h2>

          <p>The endurance and power behind athletic activities is a result of training and nutrition, but also from the type of muscle fibers that make up the athleteâ€™s physique. Genetic expression in the muscular system alters fiber type, recovery, and other aspects of muscle physiology. Muscle type and physiology varies greatly between different different types of athleticism.</p>
<p>Most research done on athletes compares individuals competing at the elite level and sedentary controls. While only a minority of ultra runners would be considered elite, the efforts they go through to train and compete at their level of endurance would suggest that ultra runners are either homozygous or heterozygous for any combination of performance enhancing polymorphisms depending on their strengths. </p>
<p>Ultra runners with a very high vo2max or who are capable of running at very high altitudes (sky running) might have a combination of performance enhancing polymorphisms being expressed in the cardiovascular/pulmonary systems such as variations in the ACE or HIF1A genes.</p>
<p>Runners who log 70+ miles most likely possess beneficial alleles in the ACTN3 gene or alleles involving the metabolism of energy, to promote slow twitch muscle fibers and cells capable of quickly metabolizing sugar and fat stores to generate energy for the muslces.</p>
