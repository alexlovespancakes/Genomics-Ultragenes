          <h2>Myostatin (MSTN)</h2>

    
	<p>A four year old german boy was reported in 2004 with a homozygous splice site mutation in intron 1 of the myostatin (MSTN) gene, resulting in muscle hypertrophy (7,8). The boy, the son of an olympic swimmer who was heterozygous for this mutation, had quadriceps muscles 7.2 standard deviations (SD) above the average with fat pads 2.88 SD below the controlâ€™s mean (7,8). Studies in mice show a doubling in muscle mass when they lack myostatin, they were more muscular and stronger than mice with myostatin.</p> 
	<p>Mutations such as this would be beneficial in athletes such as the mother, an olympic swimmer, and those who do power/sprint events. Endurance athletes would most likely have myostatin, but certain levels could benefit an endurance runner by promoting speed.  Studies done in dogs suggest that heterozygosity promotes performance in racing because of the increased muscle mass in comparison to the control, this particular genotype is the result of a frameshift mutation deleting roughly 20% of the gene(6,7). Some mutations leave the mystatin gene dysfunctional as observed in cattle, deleting the bioactive carboxy-terminal domain of protein(5,7).</p>
