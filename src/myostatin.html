          <h2>Myostatin (MSTN)</h2>

<p>A four year old german boy was reported in 2004 with a homozygous splice site mutation in intron 1 of the myostatin (MSTN) gene, resulting in muscle hypertrophy (9,10). The boy, the son of an olympic swimmer who was heterozygous for this mutation, had quadriceps muscles 7.2 standard deviations (SD) above the average with fat pads 2.88 SD below the controlâ€™s mean (9,10). Studies in mice show a doubling in muscle mass when they lack myostatin, they were more muscular and stronger than mice with myostatin(10). A G to T transversion (TGAA->TTAA) mutation takes place causing a premature stop codon at the third exon of the gene in Marchigian beef rendering the myostatin gene dysfunctional (6). Cattle with this mutation show muscle growth doubling the norm (6,9). <p>
	<p>Mutations such as this would be beneficial in athletes such as the mother, an olympic swimmer, and those who do power/sprint events or who benefit. Endurance athletes would most likely have myostatin, but certain levels could benefit an endurance runner by promoting speed.  Studies done in dogs suggest that heterozygosity promotes performance in racing because of the increased muscle mass in comparison to the control, this particular genotype is the result of a frameshift mutation deleting roughly 20% of the gene(7,9). Being heterozygous instead of homozygous would be beneficial in racing, because there would be some myostatin in the athletes system making it so they can grow muscle quickly with out being completely deficient in myostatin and having over active muscle growth. </p>
