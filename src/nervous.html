          <p> Research performed by MD Wolfgang Freund, et al. on participants of the 2009 TransEurope FootRace ultra marathon compared the the results of a cold pain tolerance test and a personality test(#). Cold pain tolerance is easily tested by having test participants place their hand in ice water while being encouraged to frequently make a fist then extend their fingers. Participants periodically rate their pain from 1-10 and when the pain from the cold water becomes unbearable, a 10, they remove their hand from the cold water. Of the eleven sedentary controls only three of them were capable of leaving their hand in the water for the entire three minutes, while not one ultra runner removed his hand from the ice water until instructed to do so (#). Ultra runners have a higher level of pain control, are less cooperative and reward dependent, and are more self centered/transcendent allowing them to ignore or control their body’s needs in order to complete a goal (#).
Pain tolerance genes play a role in both training and competing, especially in endurance runners that may log 30-3,000 miles for just one race.</p>
