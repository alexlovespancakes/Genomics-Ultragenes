          <h2>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)</h2>

        <p>One of the most discussed genes when it comes to performance enhancing polymorphisms of the cardiovascular system is the angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) gene. ACE converts angiotensin I to its useable version angiotensin II; the angiotension hormone is a component of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) (2,3,5,7).</p>
	<p>The intrinsic gene ACE is a 287 bps indel that is inserted or absent (deleted) depending on the allele. An insertion/deletion polymorphous on the ACE gene locus is likely responsible for major differences between endurance athletes and sprint athletes (7,8). The I (insertion) allele is highly associated with endurance athletes while the D (deletion) allele is more associated with power/sprint athletes (7,10). High-altitude mountaineers have managed to climb beyond 8,000m with out the help of supplemental oxygen, none of these climbers had a D/D genotype and top performers were all homozygous I genotypes (5).</p>
	<p>The 287 bps insertion  plays a role in the degradation of vasodilator bradykinin (B2R) and results in lower ACE enzyme (6,7). The ACE B2R interaction was thought to improve performance by altering the function of the cardiac and respiratory systems but it is also thought that enhanced performance is through muscle efficiency from tissue oxygenation (4,6,7).</p>
	<p>Research on athletes such as rowers, high-altitude mountaineers, long-distance runners, cyclists, and handball players shows that polymorphisms of the ACE gene are responsible for blood vessel constriction, anabolic response, inflammatory response, and in some individuals an increased risk of developing cardiac diseases (1,2,3,5,7,10). </p>
